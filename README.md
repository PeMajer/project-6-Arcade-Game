# Classic arcade game - Frogger
This game is based on the classic arcade game Frogger with provided visual assets and a game loop engine by adding a number of entities to the game including player characters and enemies.

## Game Description
The game canvas consists of 5x6 grid. In this game you have a Player and Enemies (Bugs). The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies. The player can move left, right, up and down. The enemies move in varying speeds on the paved block portion of the scene.

 Once a the player collides with an enemy:
 * The game (score, number of enemies) is reset,
 * the player moves back to the start square,
